# Snap Math App 

Repository for my Snap Math App application for Code In Place 2021's final project submission. As a math peer tutor and engineering student I made this app to help people improve their basic math/arithmetic skills. Code In Place 2021 inspired me to also create Snap Math App's mascot Sam the Sea Otter. I included Sam to help make math learning friendly and accessible like how all the Code In Place staff made programming accessible! 

I've decided to explore python's tkinter package to create the GUI for this program. It's been really fun and interesting learning and relearning python/programming creating this. I'm really excited to show this to the Code In Place community, who have been excellent and encouraging throughout the course and beyond. I'm proud to be a Code In Place participant for 2021!
